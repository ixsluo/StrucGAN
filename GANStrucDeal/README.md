# About
This is a python package to extract structure from hdf5 file generated by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and construc hdf5 file for training GAN from a sef of xyz file

# Example images

# Requirements
    * h5py

# Installation
    * (1) python setup.py build
    * (2) python setup.py install
    * If the python is the system's python, you need root and type as sudo python setup.py install
# Usage
    There is two functions in this libganstruc
    * (1) Constructing the training set file (struc.h5) of GAN using structure files *.xyz
    * (2) Extracting structure from struc.h5 generated by GAN and write it in *.xyz
    You should use this two functions as
    * >>> from libganstruc import GANStrucDeal
    * >>> a = GANStrucDeal.GANStruc()
    * >>> a.write_hd5_files(xyzpath)
    * >>> a.read_hd5_files_3D(finput)
    * xyzpath is the PATH that contains a set of xyz file
    * finput is the hdf5 file, default is struc.h5
